Hi there, I'm Mitchell Omorotionmwan.

I solve stakeholder problems by building strong relationships and transforming their data into actionable solutions. With a background in Business and Data Engineering/Analysis, I bring both insight and impact.

These days, I am particularly interested in Data Engineering, especially the design and optimization of data pipelines and workflows.
