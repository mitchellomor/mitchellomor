Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Mitchell Omorotionmwan.

Summary

Business Intelligence Analyst with a background in Business and Data Analysis

These days, I am particularly interested in Machine Learning + microcontrollers ("TinyML"), and Machine Learning + Audio ("Machine Hearing").

In my spare time I maintain the emlearn open-source software for efficient and convenient ML models on microcontrollers. I also provide a few learning resources on Machine Learning for Embedded, and Machine Learning for Audio.
